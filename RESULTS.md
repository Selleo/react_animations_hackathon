[Result](https://selleo-react-animations-hackathon.netlify.app/react-spring)

Team opinion:

- Very confusing API (if you provide object then you get only styles, if you provide function then you receive styles and API in tuple)
- Documentation is missing some explanations
- You have to rely on reverse engineering the examples
- I had problem with two separate animations to control the same css property (height) but finally found a tip in docs
- After wrapping your head around the API quirks you can do pretty nice effects

### [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

[Result](https://selleo-react-animations-hackathon.netlify.app/framer-motion)

Team opinion:

- Really pleasurable to work with library
- Easy to understand, intuitive and powerful API which is also well documented
- Works nicely with SVG
- Can make animations between SPA routes
- Library is quite heavy, but it has lightweight version if we don't need some features `import { m } from 'framer-motion'`
