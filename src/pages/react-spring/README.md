- Very confusing api (if you provide object then you get only styles, if you provide function then you receive styles and API in tuple)
- Documentation is missing some explanation
- You have to rely on reverse engineering the examples
- I had problem with two separate animations to control the same css property (height) but finally found a tip in docs
